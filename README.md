## Installation

### My Recommendation

- I recommend you to install the userstyle and inject it using a userstyle manager, like [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), I also published it on [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/): https://userstyles.world/style/6669/bga-dark, so installing from there can be more simple & convenient
- With Stylus, you can keep your dark theme up to date, which is a prominant reason, since it's still in development. 
- Moreover, there are multiple themes included in the userstyle to choose from (also some eastereggs to find...), so I think, it would be unwise to miss that opportunity

### Other Method

1. Select a .css file from the two not userstyles (one is just simply minimized), and copy its content
2. Navigate to BGA [preferences > Advanced](https://boardgamearena.com/preferences?section=advanced)
3. Paste the styling into the textarea
4. Press save
5. Clear the browser's cache (press Ctrl+F5)
6. Go to an other BGA page
7. Profit!

## Assets

***userstyle.css** [->](https://github.com/OregSamSas/boardgamearena-darkmode/blob/master/userstyle.css) contains the original userstyle with informations about the userstyles, and some costumizations, but it uses the preprocessor of Stylus, so it won't work anywhere

**style.css** [->](https://github.com/OregSamSas/boardgamearena-darkmode/blob/master/style.css) meanwhile contains the core css which would work in any browser without any extensions. This wouldn't give costumizations though. 
ATTENTION: UPDATING THIS FILE OCCURS MORE SCARCELY. IF YOU HAVE STYLUS, USE THE OTHER.

## Ideas on what to do next:

- Mobile main menu and personal notes
- The Crew: highlight black cards, darken the big red rectangle
- 7Wonders: highlight hand rotation
- ...
